HELP!! Android Studio Aliens are attacking the peaceful world of Applefanatica and a poorly rendered 8-bit version of Madden needs your help to fend them off! Take control of Madden by touching anywhere on the screen and fire AppleBlasts by tapping. Score increases with every Android Studio Alien destroyed and lives are lost whenever one gets by you, with an automatic loss if you are hit by an alien. Small explosions occur when either enemies or Madden are hit. High score is persistant between plays and app closing. Restart button brings you back to the original scene and restarts the game.
